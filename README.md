# Mnist_Digit_Recognition

MNIST Digit Recognition

This project uses the **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits (0â€“9) to train a machine learning model for digit recognition. The goal is to preprocess image data, train a classifier, and evaluate its accuracy on test samples.
 Key Features

* Uses the **MNIST** dataset from `sklearn` or `keras.datasets`
* Applies image preprocessing and normalization
* Trains a model (e.g., **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, or **Neural Network**)
* Evaluates performance using accuracy metrics

Tech Stack

* Python
* NumPy, Pandas
* Matplotlib (for visualization)
* Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras

Output

* Digit prediction on unseen data
* Accuracy score
* Confusion matrix (optional)
